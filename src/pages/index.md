  title: Why us
  description: >
    We cloned the brain of Einstein so that dumb people can become smarter than
    what they are. They won't become as smart as Einstein but they will be
    treated of their stupidity. A simple formula explains how smart you will be.
    Intelligence is measured in confusion per second (cps). Einstein has 0 cps
    and if we say someone has 30 cps (normal rate of cps is 0.0000001), he will
    have a (30 - 0)*0.000003 which is 0.00009 cps.

  A lot of our customers have an IQ of 2 but we told them that IQ dosen't
  measure intelligence it's only cps that does. So we charged them 100$ for
  surgery and they got smarter and got an IQ of 86, which is still better than
  all those techniques that involve school.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
