  title: Why us
  description: >
    We cloned the brain of Einstein so that dumb people can become smarter than
    what they are. They won't become as smart as Einstein but they will be
    treated of their stupidity. A simple formula explains how smart you will be.
    Intelligence is measured in confusion per second (cps). Einstein has 0 cps
    and if we say someone has 30 cps (normal rate of cps is 0.0000001), he will
    have a (30 - 0)*0.000003 which is 0.00009 cps.

  A lot of our customers have an IQ of 2 but we told them that IQ dosen't
  measure intelligence it's only cps that does. So we charged them 100$ for
  surgery and they got smarter and got an IQ of 86, which is still better than
  all those techniques that involve school.

        We sell knowledge transfer for 0.02$ and we are the only one in the
        market that can do this. Others don't have the experience. Knowledge
        transfer is useful when you just got your new Einstein brain and you
        wanna accumulate new knowledge that you could not accumulate before
        because your cps rate was too high.

        We also offer an option that helps you find a job. Normally, people with
        high cps rate get fewer jobs which is sad and unfair but with our
        option, you get a job in seconds. Many of our clients got jobs as
        Youtubers like Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg (Pewdiepie) and Gulshan Kumar
        (founder of T-Series).

        Unlike the other ones, we never scammed a single cent of people's money
        and we have invested in NASA which helped build technology that are in
        you smartphone. Basically, without GetSmartBrains, you would not have a
        phone. Also, you will get your money back, instantly because we
        guarantee you that you would find a job in seconds.

        We believe that intelligence should not only be for the rich, but for
        everyone and that people that perform badly in institutions should have
        the right to get a better brain for themselves. Bill Gates once said: "I
        was an idiot and I bought a brain from GetSmartBrain and here I am!".
        GetSmartBrain is committed to your brain and if you wanna get smarter,
        you can get a free consultation in Antarctica.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
