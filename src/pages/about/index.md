### We are objects

We think humans are objects that you have to upgrade so that they can perform better. Sometimes we have to do an update and it takes the same time that in a Windows Update. Also, dumb people have an HDD so we put them an SSD which is Einstein's brain.

### We are not born stupid

It is most likely your education that made you dumb and the only way to get smart is to use our product. Also you have to subscribe to Team Shawarma or it will not work.

### Sustainable brain

It works well with the type of food you eat. You don't need to be in perfect shape for it to work.

### Direct sourcing

Comes directly from Einstein's brain and then we clone it. I know it's cool.

### Reinvest profits

We reinvest profits into Microsoft and Apple.
